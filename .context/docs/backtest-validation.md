## Backtest Validation & Reporting — Signals vs Bot via the CLOB

How we measure whether the strategy actually wins: resolve every market against the
**Polymarket CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) orderbook we recorded**, then report hit-rate + PnL
two ways — the **strategy**
(the signal, mapped to the window it intends to bet) and the **bot** (what it actually traded).
This is the "source of truth" behind the manual validation in
[tradingview-runbook.md](tradingview-runbook.md) §4. For data collection itself see
[data-flow.md](data-flow.md); for terms see [glossary.md](glossary.md).

## 1. Why this exists

A signal firing on the chart says nothing about whether it was right. To grade it we need the
real outcome of each 15-minute (or 5-minute) Polymarket up/down market. Two facts make that
non-trivial, and shaped the design:

- **Gamma de-indexes expired micro-markets.** `gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets?slug=…` returns
  *nothing* for a closed `btc-updown-15m-*` market (querying by `condition_ids` is empty too).
  The candle approximation (Coinbase close vs open) is only a proxy and **has disagreed with the
  CLOB** (see §5). So neither is the authority.
- **The recorder already captures the truth.** It polls each market's CLOB orderbook every ~2s up
  to expiry (`backtest/data/backtest.db`). At expiry the **winning** outcome token bids ~$0.99 and
  the **loser** asks ~$0.01 — an unambiguous, replayable resolution we own. This is the project's
  gold: Polymarket has no historical L2 API, so only what we recorded exists.

## 2. Outcome resolution: CLOB → Gamma → candle

`settlement.resolve_outcome(con, slug, window_start, window_end)`
([backtest/settlement.py](../../backtest/settlement.py)) tries three sources in trust order and
stamps the winner in `markets.outcome` with `markets.outcome_source`:

| Source | How | When it wins |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clob` | `clob_outcome()` — last recorded snapshot per side ≤ `window_end + 30s`; winner = side with `best_bid ≥ 0.90` **and** loser `best_ask ≤ 0.10` | Authoritative; used whenever we have a decisive recorded book |
| `gamma` | `gamma.get_resolved_outcome()` — `outcomePrices` on a market flagged `closed` | Fallback (rare for these de-indexed markets) |
| `candle` | `_candle_outcome()` — Coinbase BTC-USD candle, `close ≥ open ⇒ YES` | Last resort; **approximation only** |

The two price numbers play different roles: **~$0.99 / ~$0.01** is what a *resolved* market's book
actually shows, while **0.90 / 0.10** are the deliberately tolerant *decision thresholds* — loose
enough that a snapshot taken a few seconds before the final tick still resolves, strict enough to
reject a still-live book. `clob_outcome` returns `None` (not a guess) when books are missing or not
yet decisive (e.g. a pre-expiry 0.60/0.40 book), so the caller falls through cleanly. Prices are
stored as integer thousandths (`best_bid_m`, 0–1000) — exact, no float drift.

## 3. Running it

```bash
# 1. (Optional) Resolve outcomes for all expired markets, CLOB-first, into
#    markets.outcome. `report` already runs this internally — use `settle` on
#    its own only to populate/inspect outcomes without a full report.
uv run python -m backtest settle

# 2. The report (self-contained: runs settle internally): strategy vs bot,
#    hit-rate + PnL, resolved via the CLOB.
uv run python -m backtest report                       # defaults: live stream, 15m, $1 stake
uv run python -m backtest report --start 2026-06-12 --end 2026-06-13
uv run python -m backtest report --series 5m --signal-source tradingview_csv_300s
```

`report` flags: `--start/--end` (ISO date/datetime or unix seconds), `--series {15m,5m}`,
`--signal-source` (SQL LIKE on `signals.source`, default `tradingview` = the live webhook stream),
`--stake` (default `1.0`), `--bot-trades` (default `tv_dry_run_trades.json`). It runs `settle`
internally, so a bare `report` is self-contained. Note: the **[BOT]** view scales to the stake the bot
actually recorded (`MARKET_BUY_USD`, currently $3); **[ESTRATÉGIA]** uses `--stake` — pass `--stake 3` to
compare the two like-for-like. Annotated output:

```
FONTE DA VERDADE — SINAIS vs BOT (resolvido via CLOB)

```

> Os números `$+4.14`/`$+4.10` acima são do primeiro registro (era zero-fee) e estão **brutos**. Com

The report prints timestamps in **UTC**; §5 below narrates in **local time (UTC-3)** — the same
dropped DOWN is `03:30 UTC` in the output and `00:30` in the findings.

## 4. The two views (and why they differ)

The same signal can read as WIN in one view and LOSS in the other — that gap is the point.

- **[ESTRATÉGIA]** — `engine.run_replay`. Each signal is mapped to the window it intends to bet:
  the **next** 15-minute window, "N+1". The mapping is `ingest.attach_target_tokens`'
  `floor(ts/900)*900`; this lands on N+1 (not the window that just closed) because the signal's
  timestamp *is* the bar close, which is also the next window's start. Same intent as
  `csv_hitrate.py`. It then simulates a market-buy on the recorded ask book (real slippage, no
  look-ahead — `merge_asof` matches the first snapshot at or after the signal) and settles against
  `markets.outcome`. This grades the **signal**, independent of bot bugs.
- **[BOT]** — `bot_trades.evaluate_bot_trades`. Reads `tv_dry_run_trades.json` (the market the bot
  **actually** bought + the entry price it paid) and resolves that market via `clob_outcome`.
  `conversion_stats` matches received signals (DB) to executed trades by timestamp (±5s) and lists
  the **dropped** ones. This grades **execution reality**.

PnL model (both views): buying `$stake` at price `p` yields `stake/p` tokens; each winning token
redeems `$1`. `pnl = payout − stake` (identical to `settlement.settle_fill`).

**Taker fee (15m/5m crypto).** These markets are no longer zero-fee: the taker pays
`fee = C × feeRate × p × (1 − p)` — where `C` is the number of shares traded (`stake / p`) — crypto
`feeRate = 0.07`, **collected in shares on a buy**, so a
win pays out fewer shares while a loss is unchanged (you still lose the full stake). The fee is
symmetric around `p = 0.50` (its peak, ~3.5% of notional) and negligible at the extremes — so it
bites hardest on the fresh ~$0.50 entries the rollover fix now targets. Both views net it out:
`matching.simulate_market_buy(fee_rate=…)` skims it from `filled_tokens`, and
`bot_trades.evaluate_bot_trades(fee_rate=…)` does the same from the bot's logged entry. `report`
and `replay` default `--fee-rate 0.07`; pass `--fee-rate 0` for non-fee markets. Maker orders pay
zero, but the bot sends **market (taker)** orders, so the fee applies. Always prefer the live
`feeRate` per market (`feesEnabled`/`getClobMarketInfo`) over the hardcoded default — Polymarket
changes it without notice.

## 5. Findings (2026-06-12 → 13, first live night)

The report surfaces these automatically; recorded here so they aren't rediscovered:

- **Rollover race (entry price).** The "Once per bar close" alert fires at `:00/:15/:30/:45`, which
  is exactly when a 15m Polymarket window **expires**. The bot sometimes still points at the
  expiring window (buys near-resolved, ~$0.99, no edge) and sometimes the fresh one (~$0.50).
  Evidence: 21:15 UP filled at **$0.99** (expiring) vs 22:45 UP at **$0.465** (fresh). Not
  systematic — a race in `current_instrument_index` at the boundary.
- **DOWN signals get dropped.** The 00:30 DOWN was received and logged by the recorder but produced
  **no trade** — the bot bailed before recording (most likely `_no_instrument_id is None` →
  *"cannot bet DOWN. Skipping trade"* in [bot.py](../../bot.py), around line 1491). Confronted with the CLOB it
  would have **won** (the N+1 window resolved NO). A winning signal lost to a bug, not a bad call.
- **Candle ≠ CLOB.** For the 00:30 window the CLOB resolved **NO** but the Coinbase candle said
  **YES** — the first disagreement. Polymarket settles on Chainlink BTC/USD, not Coinbase; near a
  coin-flip the proxy flips. Confirms the CLOB must be the authority, candle only a last resort.

## 6. Pre-live fix list

Fixing these is **out of scope for the report** (it only measures), but they are the open items the
data exposes — clear them before turning dry run off (also see
[tradingview-runbook.md](tradingview-runbook.md) §5):

1. **Market selection at rollover** — ✅ **FIXED.** The webhook path now picks the market by wall
   clock (`floor(now/900)*900`, identical to `attach_target_tokens`' N+1 mapping) instead of
   `current_instrument_index`, and prices it from the pre-subscribed next market's own book, so
   entries land near $0.50 not $0.99. See `tv_market_select.py` (`select_target_market`,
   `fresh_quote`), `bot.py` (`_ensure_next_subscribed`, `_handle_tradingview_signal`), and the
   `test_rollover_market_selection` test. ✅ **Confirmed live (2026-06-13):** post-deploy webhook
   trades land on the fresh N+1 window — e.g. an UP filled `YES @ $0.455` and a DOWN `NO @ $0.515`
   while the expiring window's token sat at ~$0.99.
2. **DOWN execution path** — ✅ **FIXED (side-effect of #1).** The webhook path now passes the target
   market's `no_instrument_id` **explicitly** into `_place_real_order` (instead of the stale
   `self._no_instrument_id`), so DOWN buys the freshly-selected, fully-loaded N+1 market's NO token.
   Observed live (2026-06-13): a DOWN signal traded `NO @ $0.515` where before every DOWN dropped.
   Watch that subsequent DOWN signals keep converting (a market loaded without its NO token could
   still drop).
3. **Polymarket API key 401** — credentials in `.env` are invalid; dry run masks it
   (`submit_order` skipped). Regenerate `POLYMARKET_API_KEY`/`SECRET`/`PASSPHRASE` before live, or
   the first real order fails with 401 (see runbook §7).
